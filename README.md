# Ubiquitous-Traffic-Eye
## Trajectory data introduction
My data publication is on the way, star me for latest publication.

These datasets include quantities vehicle trajectories at several sites. The dataset is extracted from aerial videos. Labor work is used to ensure accuracy.
Each file is a group of sample, extracted on different sites and time, also in dynamic traffic conditions.

Data available for download from this website include: video files with object identification box, raw track data and data format description. The original vehicle track data includes vehicle number, position coordinates, lane number, vehicle length, vehicle width, driving speed, time headway, space headway, plus/minus speed and other parameters, with a time accuracy of 0.1 second and a position accuracy of 0.01 m.

# Data can be obtianed now
